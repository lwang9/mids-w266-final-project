The two screw elements according to the invention, which are located opposite each other directly adjacent on two directly adjacent screw shafts, practically clean each other in pairs. The invention also relates to the use of the screw element according to the invention in a multishaft screw machine and to a multishaft screw machine which is equipped with a pair of screw elements according to the invention, as well as to a method for the extrusion of plastic or viscoelastic masses using the screw element according to the invention.   \n","18604                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A process for producing an alkene-containing product stream by oxidative dehydrogenation is disclosed herein. The process comprises providing a primary feedstream comprising a C2-C6 alkane through a reactor system having total “n” reaction stages in series. The “n” can vary from 2 to 20. The process further comprises providing a secondary feedstream comprising oxygen to each of the reaction stages and producing an effluent stream comprising alkene, alkane, and oxygen from each of the reaction stages. The effluent stream from reaction stages 1 through “n−1” is cooled to generate an input feedstream that is fed to the immediate next reaction stage. The process thus produced an alkene-containing product stream in the “n”th reaction stage. Each of the reaction stages is substantially adiabatic.   \n","\n","

The two screw elements according to the invention, which are located opposite each other directly adjacent on two directly adjacent screw shafts, practically clean each other in pairs. The invention also relates to the use of the screw element according to the invention in a multishaft screw machine and to a multishaft screw machine which is equipped with a pair of screw elements according to the invention, as well as to a method for the extrusion of plastic or viscoelastic masses using the screw element according to the invention.   \n","18604                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A process for producing an alkene-containing product stream by oxidative dehydrogenation is disclosed herein. The process comprises providing a primary feedstream comprising a C2-C6 alkane through a reactor system having total “n” reaction stages in series. The “n” can vary from 2 to 20. The process further comprises providing a secondary feedstream comprising oxygen to each of the reaction stages and producing an effluent stream comprising alkene, alkane, and oxygen from each of the reaction stages. The effluent stream from reaction stages 1 through “n−1” is cooled to generate an input feedstream that is fed to the immediate next reaction stage. The process thus produced an alkene-containing product stream in the “n”th reaction stage. Each of the reaction stages is substantially adiabatic.   \n","\n","

formulas, wherein the calculator has at least one writing area, and can output the calculation results of the handwritten formulas in the writing area, wherein the setting of the writing area does not compromise the functional completeness of the calculator compared to a traditional calculator, and also does not change the operating habits when using the calculator as a traditional calculator, that is, the calculator provides different methods to obtain calculation results and allows verification of the calculation results obtained using an alternative method. this reduces the probability of errors in the calculation results caused by user mistakes when compared to verifying the calculation results using the same method. 1. a calculator capable of outputting results based on handwritten formulas, said calculator has at least one writing area, and comprises a power supply unit, a calculation processor electrically connected to said power supply unit, a keypad circuit and a display screen electrically connected to said calculation processor, a central data processor electrically connected to said power supply unit, an identification calculation module electrically connected to said central data processor, and at least one flexible sensing layer electrically connected to said identification calculation module, wherein said central data processor is further electrically connected to said display screen, and said flexible sensing layer is configured within said writing area, so that a writing trace in said writing area can be sensed by said flexible sensing layer and
